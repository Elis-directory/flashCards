Term,Definition,Category,Difficulty
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS),"Compromise of one long-term key does not expose past session keys; each session remains protected even if the long-term key is later stolen.",Cryptography / Key Management,Medium
Password Hashing,"A defensive control that reduces the value of a stolen password database by storing hashes instead of plaintext passwords.",Authentication / Defensive Controls,Easy
Network Segmentation,"A defensive control that limits lateral movement and reduces blast radius by separating systems or network zones.",Network Security / Defensive Controls,Easy
CSR (Certificate Signing Request),"A cryptographic request sent to a Certificate Authority to obtain a certificate; it includes identity information and a public key.",PKI / Certificates,Medium
OID (Object Identifier),"A hierarchical identifier used in standards to uniquely name objects such as cryptographic algorithms, certificate extensions, attributes, and protocol-defined data types; it is globally unambiguous through delegated assignment.",PKI / Standards,Medium
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT),"A long-term attack campaign conducted by organized, well-resourced attackers, often associated with nation-state-level capability.",Threat Actors / Attack Types,Easy
CTR Mode,"A block cipher mode that combines a unique counter with an encryption key to generate a pseudorandom keystream used to encrypt data.",Cryptography / Encryption Modes,Medium
SRTP,"The secure form of RTP for real-time media; it provides encryption, message authentication, and integrity protection.",Network Security / Secure Protocols,Medium
Bluesnarfing vs Bluejacking,"Bluesnarfing is unauthorized access to or exfiltration from a Bluetooth device, while Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth.",Wireless Security / Bluetooth,Easy
LDAP,"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol used to query and manage directory resources such as users, groups, and objects.",Directory Services / Identity,Easy
LDAP Injection,"An attack against applications that build LDAP queries from untrusted input, allowing crafted input to alter directory queries.",Directory Services / Injection Attacks,Medium
XML Injection,"An attack against applications that generate or process XML-formatted data, targeting XML handling rather than directory queries.",Application Security / Injection Attacks,Medium
Downgrade Attack vs Disassociation,"A downgrade attack forces the use of weaker security protocols or ciphers, while disassociation forces clients off a connection.",Network Security / Wireless Attacks,Medium
GCM,"An authenticated encryption mode that provides confidentiality plus integrity and authentication.",Cryptography / Encryption Modes,Medium
GCM vs ECB/CBC/CFB,"GCM provides both encryption and authentication, while ECB, CBC, and CFB provide encryption but do not inherently provide authentication.",Cryptography / Encryption Modes,Medium
Agentless,"Means no malicious agent is installed on the target endpoint; activity may occur through network or protocol interaction, or passive monitoring.",Security Operations / Threat Methods,Medium
KDC (Key Distribution Center),"The central service that distributes keys and supports authentication in systems such as Kerberos.",Authentication / Kerberos,Medium
WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup),"A feature designed to simplify wireless setup and device onboarding for non-technical users.",Wireless Security,Easy
RSA vs DES vs AES,"RSA is a public-key cryptosystem used for encryption and digital signatures; DES is a legacy symmetric algorithm considered weak; AES is a fast symmetric algorithm.",Cryptography / Algorithms,Medium
TKIP vs WPA2,"TKIP was designed to address weaknesses in WEP, while WPA2 primarily uses CCMP, which is AES-based; TKIP is associated with WPA and transitional legacy use, not WPA2’s primary design.",Wireless Security / Wi-Fi Standards,Medium
RSA,"A public-key cryptosystem used for encryption and digital signatures, and historically for key exchange.",Cryptography / Algorithms,Easy
WEP and RC4,"WEP uses RC4, and RC4 is deprecated and considered unsafe for modern use.",Wireless Security / Legacy Cryptography,Easy
Pass the Hash,"An attack where a captured password hash is used directly for authentication without needing the cleartext password.",Authentication Attacks,Medium
DNS Spoofing vs DNS Cache Poisoning vs ARP Poisoning,"DNS spoofing is the broad act of providing false DNS data to redirect users; DNS cache poisoning inserts false DNS records so a domain resolves to an attacker-controlled IP; ARP poisoning manipulates local MAC-to-IP mappings and does not change DNS name resolution.",Network Security / Network Attacks,Medium
